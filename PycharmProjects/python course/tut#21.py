#OPERATORS IN PYTHON

#Arithmetic operator
#Assignment operator
#Comparision operator
#Logical operator
#Identity operator
#Membership operator
#Bitwise operator

#Arithmetic operator
print("5 + 6 is", 5+6)
print("5 - 6 is", 5-6)
print("5 * 6 is", 5*6)
print("5 / 6 is", 5/6)
print("5 ** 6 is", 5**6)
print("5 % 5 is", 5%5)
print("5 // 6 is", 5//6)

#Assignment operator
x =5
print(x)
x +=7 # += is a operator which adds 7 + 5 # you can add anything in the place of +
print(x)

#Comparision operator
i =8
print(i == 5)# 8 is not equal to 5 -false
print(i != 5)# 8 is not equal to 5 -true
print(i >= 5)# 8 is greater than 5 -true
print(i <= 5)# 8 is smaller than 5 -true

#Logical operator
a = True
b = False
print(a and a)#true and true =true
print(a and b)#true and false =false
print(a or a)# if there is true it will print true only
print(a is a)
print(a is not 5)

# Identity Operators
print(a is a)
print(a is not 5)

# Membership Operators
list = [3, 3,2, 2,39, 33, 35,32]
print(324 not in list)

# Bitwise Operators
 #0 - 00
 #1 - 01
 #2 - 10
 #3 - 11

print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3)
